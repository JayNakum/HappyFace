A Scene Based OpenGL Renderer(sort of) written in C++. It implements every concept that I have been learning.
It's primarily a playground for me to try to implement different graphics programming techniques.
I will keep adding new features to this framework as I will learn new topics in future. Eventually, the plan is to create a "scene-based" engine, where you can load up some model(s), add some fancy lights, and virtually explore it.

## Features
- Model Loading
- Light Loading (to be pushed)
- Skybox (todo)

## Getting Started
The project comes with a visual studio solution, just open it and you are good to go!  
To simply use the renderer, you only have to ```#include "happyface.h"```. An example is already in the repository, [TestApp.cpp](./HappyFace/src/TestApp.cpp)
